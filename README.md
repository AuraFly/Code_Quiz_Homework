# Code_Quiz_Homework
## This is my homework for week two of JavaScript in the PT coding bootcamp. Our assignment is to create a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions.

- The motivation for myself is to demonstrate what I have learned over the last month and demonstrate that I have built on my ability to use javascript, and also continue to use html and css to some degree.
- This time around on this assignment I tried to stay away from google as much as possible and use what I have learned without having to look it up. Due to this I believe some of my code looks bulky and could be handled differently, but it helped me solidify the things I have learned and lets me now build onto that foundation.
- Also during this assignment I learned the hard way about scoping and ensuring variables I use often are globally scoped.
- I also learned how to use timers, alter dom elements, and store values locally a bit better.
- Overall I dont think the assignment was very hard, but I had fun with it and tried to make it my own.

## Usage

1. As the page loads, the user should see a front page explaining how it works. After clicking on "Start Quiz!" the quiz will start.

2. Once started, the user will see the timer start and will be given a question and a set of answers that can be selected via mouse-click.

3. If the answer selected is correct, a confirmation will appear to confirm, then move to the next question.

4.  If the answer selected is incorrect, a confirmation will appear to confirm, deduct 5 seconds from the timer, and then move to the next question.

5. Once all 10 questions have been answered, or the time has expired, the user will see a result screen and a text field to enter their name.

6. When entering their name and submitting, their name, time left, and score will be stored and entered into the scoreboard. Lastly - the quiz can be retaken by clicking the "Play again?" button.
